# Project Title  
**Robot Grid Controller**  

## Description  
This project involves developing an interactive Python interface to control a robot navigating a grid. It includes features to configure the grid size, the robot's initial position and orientation, and to provide navigation commands through a user interface. The project uses `Tkinter` for the graphical interface and Python's standard libraries for additional functionality.
